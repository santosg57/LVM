First, thank you very much for all of your help. We are getting close to having a functioning XNAT.

 

One major issue for me is that we are expecting lots of data. My IT folks tell me that it is unwise to have a single Linux RAID file system span more than 9 physical disks because the time to rebuild after failure becomes unsafe. So, I have a number of separate RAID partitions in order to gain sufficient storage for the projects. I need to find a way to have XNAT distribute its data across these partitions.

 

Has anyone else run across these problems? Suggestions (either within XNAT or using a Linux based solution) would be most welcome.

Our friends at Iowa have some good experience building out custom big storage, and I hope they'll chime in.  A good option that they've promoted is creating RAID 5 (or maybe 6) pools and then aggregating with OpenSolaris.  We're actually planning to roll out a backup storage system using this approach.  Another option is to invest is a scale-out NAS system like Isilon, Bluearc, Netapp, etc. More expensive though.

I'm forwarding to our IT guys who can reply off list if they have additional thoughts and they can send you quotes for the backup system we're purchasing.
